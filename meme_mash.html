<h1>Time is Relative in Meadows</h1>

<img src="TIME.jpg" alt="time is relative mashup"  height="400"> 


<p>Time is Relative in Meadows is a homage to time memes mixed with a healthy dose of steampunk. I adore steampunk with its gears and steel pipes and whimsical industrial nature, and mixed with ornate clocks and time memes, you get this rather abstracted piece filled with gears and all manner of glitched text and afterimages. </p>
<p>The overall message to the viewer is to stop and "smell the roses," a metaphor on how our lives make us rush to survive and that we are not living in the moment and enjoying ourselves enough from how much we overthink. </p>
<p>I very much enjoyed playing around with all the fonts in photoshop as well as selecting the gear images and effects; I found a really cool rust effect that I lowered the opacity on to make the background photo look older. </p>
